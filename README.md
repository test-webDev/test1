# Project Title (Replace this with your actual project title)

## Description

(Provide a brief description of your project. What does it do? What is its purpose?  What problem does it solve?)

For example:
* "This project is a simple HTML website showcasing my web development skills."
* "A basic HTML page demonstrating the structure of a webpage."
* "My first HTML project."

## Installation

(Usually, HTML projects don't require installation.  If you have any specific instructions, add them here.  If not, you can omit this section or just say "No installation required.")

For example:
* "No installation required. Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser."

## Usage

(Explain how to use your project.  What are the steps to view or use the HTML file?)

For example:
1.  "Clone this repository to your local machine."
2.  "Navigate to the project directory in your terminal."
3.  "Open the `index.html` file in your web browser (e.g., by double-clicking the file, or by right-clicking and choosing 'Open with' and selecting your browser)."

##  What I Learned (Optional)

(This section is great for reflecting on your learning process, especially for beginner projects.  What did you learn while creating this HTML file?)

For example:
* "Learned the basic structure of an HTML document ( `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>` tags)."
* "Practiced using HTML tags for headings, paragraphs, and links."
* "Explored how to add basic styling with inline CSS."

##  Features (Optional)

(If your HTML file has specific features, list them here.  If it's a very basic file, you can skip this.)

For example:
* "Displays a heading and a paragraph of text."
* "Includes a link to another website."
* "Uses a basic HTML form."

## Contributing

(If you want to allow others to contribute to your project, add information here.  Since it's a simple HTML file, this might not be relevant, but you can include it if you plan to expand the project later.)

## License

(If you have a license for your project, specify it here.  If not, you can omit this.)

## Author

(Add your name here)
For example:
* "Created by [Your Name]"
* "Author: [Your Name]"

##  Link to Repository

(It's good practice to include a link to your repository)
* Repository: [https://github.com/test-webDev/test1.git](https://github.com/test-webDev/test1.git)
